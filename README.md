Artificial Intelligence is assisting developers by speeding up their workflows, automating boilerplate code generation, and giving them an extra set of eyes to look for security vulnerabilities and performance issues within their applications. Teams of any size can benefit by using a new set of AI-assisted development tools released by Amazon Web Services. In this course, Halvanta founder Jeremy Villeneuve guides you through some hands-on examples of how CodeWhisper can be used to auto generate and suggest code within your existing code editor. Learn how to use CodeGuru Security to scan your code and offer you suggestions for additional security and performance enhancements. Plus, find out how to integrate CodeGuru Profiler into an example Python application for analyzing runtime metrics to spot performance issues.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
