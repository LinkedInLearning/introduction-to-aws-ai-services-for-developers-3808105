Artificial Intelligence is assisting developers by speeding up their workflows, automating boilerplate code generation, and giving them an extra set of eyes to look for security vulnerabilities and performance issues within their applications. Teams of any size can benefit by using a new set of AI-assisted development tools released by Amazon Web Services. In this course, Halvanta founder Jeremy Villeneuve guides you through some hands-on examples of how CodeWhisper can be used to auto generate and suggest code within your existing code editor. Learn how to use CodeGuru Security to scan your code and offer you suggestions for additional security and performance enhancements. Plus, find out how to integrate CodeGuru Profiler into an example Python application for analyzing runtime metrics to spot performance issues.
